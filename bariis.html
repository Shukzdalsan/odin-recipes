    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="section">
    <p>Bariis is a traditional Somali rice dish that is known for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. Typically made with basmati rice, Bariis combines a delightful mix of ingredients that result in a savory and slightly sweet taste. The preparation starts with sautéing onions and garlic in ghee or oil until they are golden brown, infusing the base with a deep, caramelized flavor. Spices such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and cumin are then added, creating a fragrant and warm profile that is characteristic of Somali cuisine.</p>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
   <div class="section">
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the Rice: Thoroughly rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 20-30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>Sauté Onions and Garlic: In a large pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until they are golden brown. Add minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add Spices: Stir in the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, and cumin seeds. Cook for a few minutes until the spices release their aroma.</li>
        <li>Incorporate Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes to the pot and cook until they soften and blend with the onions and spices, creating a thick mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook the Rice: Add the drained rice to the pot, stirring to coat the grains with the spice mixture. Pour in water or broth (typically in a ratio of 1.5 to 2 parts liquid to 1 part rice). Season with salt to taste. </li>
        <li>Add Optional Ingredients: If using raisins or currants, peas, or carrots, add them to the pot at this stage. Stir gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Meat (if using): While the rice is cooking, prepare the meat separately. Season the meat with spices that complement the rice (such as cumin, coriander, and turmeric) and cook it until tender.</li>
        <li>Rest the Rice: Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Fluff the rice with a fork and transfer it to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro and fried onions. Serve with the prepared meat on the side, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
