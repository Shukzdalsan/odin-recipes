      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="section">
      <p>Malawah is a traditional Somali sweet pancake known for its delicate texture and subtly spiced flavor. Made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and a hint of cardamom, these pancakes are lightly fried to a golden brown. The addition of cardamom gives Malawah a fragrant, aromatic quality, making it a unique treat. Often enjoyed with a drizzle of honey or a sprinkle of sugar, Malawah is a versatile dish that can be served for breakfast, as a snack, or even as a dessert, typically accompanied by a cup of tea or coffee.</p>

        <li>Prepare the Batter: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cardamom powder, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add Wet Ingredients: In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and add milk. Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring constantly. Add water little by little until you achieve a smooth, pourable batter.</li>
        <li>Heat the Pan: Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with oil or butter.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pancakes: Pour a ladleful of batter onto the pan, spreading it out evenly. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges begin to lift, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat: Continue this process with the remaining batter, greasing the pan as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the Malawah warm, drizzled with honey or sugar, and enjoy with tea or coffee.</li>
